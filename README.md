# Accompany App

Accompany App is designed to assist individuals during pregnancy. When someone is ready to become a parent, they often feel nervous and uncertain about what they need to do to prepare for the journey. This is where our application comes in handy. One of the most significant features is the provision of trimester-specific to-do lists, which guide users on the essential things they need to do or check. The information is reliable and has been provided by a trusted source, my midwife sister.


## Features:

👼🏻 TodoLists: A feature that allows users to create personalized to-do lists and receive notifications tailored to their specific trimester to remind them to complete their tasks.

👼 Due Date: A feature that allows users to calculate the number of days remaining until their baby's due date.

👼🏼 Photo Album: A feature that enables users to upload photos from their phone or camera, and can view them in a detailed screen.

👼🏽 Contraction Timer: A feature that enables users to record the frequency and duration of their contractions.

👼🏾 Notes: A feature that enables users to record important details such as their mood, symptoms, or other relevant information.

👼🏿 Settings: A feature that enables users to configure their profile details and submit feedback to the official email of Accompany.

Accompany App was built using Swift and the UIKit framework.
