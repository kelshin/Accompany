Background:

Our application is designed to assist individuals during pregnancy. When someone is ready to become a parent, they often feel nervous and uncertain about what they need to do to prepare for the journey. This is where our application comes in handy. One of the most significant features is the provision of trimester-specific to-do lists, which guide users on the essential things they need to do or check. The information is reliable and has been provided by a trusted source, my midwife sister.
