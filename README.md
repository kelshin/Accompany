Background:

Our application is related to pregnancy. When the person is ready to be a father or mother, they always feel nervous and have no ideas what they should do or prepare for during their pregnancy. Thatâ€™s why they need this application. One of the most important features is that we will give to-do lists for things they have to do/check in different trimesters. The information is reliable and provided by my mid-wife friend.


Design of our App:

After launching app, it will show one pop up window to ask the due date of user's baby. 

There are two options: 

1. Answer -> Go to Answer Page, then user can choose the date (limit the date from current date+0) via datePicker.

In this page, if users press done with no pick date -> it will show one alert window to make sure users have already picked; otherwise, will go to HomeViewPage.

if they press back button -> go back PopUpPage.

2. Don't know -> Just in case users have no idea about the date, we make this option. -> Go to HomeViewPage.
